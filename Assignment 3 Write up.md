# Assignment_3_Write Up
For assignment 3, I am using the same dataset that I used for hypothesis testing in Assignment 2, but this time I will perform regression analysis. Using the 80 Cereals dataset from Kaggle, I would like to see whether the consumer rating for a cereal is influenced by the shelf placement and grams of sugars. I hypothesize that cereals with more sugars have higher consumer ratings and that cereals placed on shelves higher than floor level have higher customer ratings. The null hypothesis would be that neither grams of sugar nor shelf placement have a positive influence on customer ratings of cereals.

In this example, the continuous dependent variable is the customer rating, which can take any value between 0 and 100 percent. The independent variables include the grams of sugars and the shelf placement (shelf 1, 2, or 3).

Before building a regression model, I’ll start by uploading the data to R studio and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). I calculated the mean, median, and standard deviation for each variable. EDA and descriptive statistics allowed me to see the structure of the data by summarizing it to provide an overview of each variable.

I started the regression analysis by performing simple linear regression (SLR) against the dependent variable by each independent variable separately. I wanted to see the relationship between each variable separately before examining them altogether. The SLR of customer rating based on grams of sugars clearly shows a decreasing trend, indicating that the more grams of sugars the cereal contains, the lower the customer rating. When I performed the SLR for customer rating based on shelf placement, the line was horizontal, which suggests that the shelf placement doesn’t have an impact on customer rating. So far, I can’t accept my alternate hypothesis because I believed that both sugars and shelf placement would have a positive influence on customer rating.

Lastly, I built a multiple linear regression model to see what would happen when both independent variables were considered at the same time. The significance codes confirm what I found out from the SLR. Only sugars have a significant relationship toward customer rating, although it is a negative one and not positive like I predicted. The p-value for sugars is 7.21e-16, which is highly significant. The model shows that for each additional gram of sugar, the cereal’s rating drops about 2.43 points, a significant negative relationship between grams of sugars and customer rating. The adjusted R-squared is 0.5764 which means about 58% of the variance in customer rating can be predicted by grams sugars and shelf placement. I think this is because only one of the variables can predict customer rating, in this case grams of sugars. The adjusted R-squared of the MLR is about the same as it was for the sugars SLR, which I think is because the shelf placement has no effect at all. In this example, my null hypothesis is correct. Neither variable has a positive influence on customer ratings. Even though sugars do have a significant relationship, it is negative. I would reject my alternate hypothesis in this scenario.
